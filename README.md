This website follows responsive web design, uses w3.css. It uses PHP.
So to experience the feel of this website, local XAMP/MAMP server will be required(free download available on internet). 

Following steps would be needed :)
1. Download XAMP/MAMP  depending on if you are PC/Mac user (I am referring it to view php files) and complete installation.
2. After installation is done, navigate to the ‘htdocs’ folder inside this parent folder XAMP/MAMP and paste website folder ‘live’ in there.
3. Launch the MAMP/XAMP server on your computer system
4. Open a web browser and paste the  link http://localhost/live/livekirtan.com/index.php
